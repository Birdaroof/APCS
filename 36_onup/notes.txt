Debugging 
3 Different Types of Errors
  - Compile-time Errors
    - Usually indicate something is wrong with the syntax
      - Best way to avoid errors is to use incremental development
      - In the case of multiple error messages, it does not mean that there are multiple errors, in this case, refer to the first error
      - Reading error messages can help find the issue
      - Sometimes the error messages are misleading and not helpful
      - Afterwards check for common syntax issues
        - Check parantheses and brackets (make sure they are properly nested and balanced)
        - Check for the case of letters (java is type sensitive)
        - Double quotes for strings and single quotes for chars
        - Types should match
        - If using a value method make sure to return the result and use it
        - If using a void method, don't try to do anything with the result
      - If these still don't work, it's possible the program is not reading the right file
        - You can test this by putting an intentional error which should be spotted by the code
        - This will let you know if you are reading the right file or not
      - You can cut your code apart into halfs and then smaller and smaller pieces until you find the error
  - Run-time Errors
    - Usually caused by infinite loops
      - To test where the program is starting to 'hang' you can put a print statement before and after the loop. 
        - If you see the first print statement but not the second that means that something is going wrong within that loop
        - You can then use print statements to print the condition and variables within the loop
          - This will help with finding what is going wrong
        - You can also put print statements at the start of method calls, this will help you find and follow the flow of execution
        - Exceptions
          - Examine where the error occured and read the message
          - NullPointerException means that the variable is currently null.
          - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException means you are trying to access an index that does not exist
          - FileNotFoundException means that you are likely working in the wrong folder or with the wrong files
          - ArithmeticException - usually division by zero
        - Print statements are cruical to finding errors and helping you understand your code
          - However you should be careful to make sure that you are not printing too many statements as that can become confusing
          - Make sure to simplify your print statements, or comment out print statements that have already been verified and tested
          - You can also simplify the problem or the methods
          - Find the minimal test case
          - Try reorganizing the program
  - Logic Errors
    - Program is doing the wrong thing
      - Make a connection between the code and the behavior
      - Make a mental model
        - Break the program into components and test them independently
        - This will test and help build up your mental model
      - Common Errors
        - Integer Divison always rounds towards zero
        - Don't use == with doubles
        - == checks if two things are identical (objects) whereas equals actually checks for equivalence
      - Break down complex expressions using variables to make it easier to understand and test
      - Utilize temporary variables
  - Nothing Works
    - Take a break from the computer
      - This will help you relax and destress
      - Taking a break can help you think about the program more clearly or in a different way
    - Before asking for help, try to isolate the error and simplify the code.
      - Make it easier for them to help you
    - Consult your duckie!
